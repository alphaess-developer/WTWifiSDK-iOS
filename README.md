## WTWifiSDK-iOS

WTWifiSDK is a Framework for wifi configuration  **for** alphaess.

## ðŸ”¨ Requirements

The system requirement for WTWifiSDK is iOS 11.0+

## Install

`pod 'WTWifiSDK'`

## How to use?

* `#import "WTWifiSDK/WTWifiCenter.h"`

* You can get device serial number from ap, for example:

  ```objective-c
   [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] fetchSystemSN:^(NSString * _Nullable ssid) {
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
             // Load ssid success, and refresh UI.
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
          // Error
      }];
  ```

* Get the wifi ssid list from wifi collector device, for example:

  ```objective-c
   [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] fetchWifiList:^(NSArray * _Nullable list) {
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
              self.ssids = list;
              [self.tableview reloadData];
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
          // Error
      }];
  ```

* And if you want to config the local wifi for energy storage device, use this api:

  ```objective-c
   [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] wifiConfigurationWith:account password:password success:^(bool result) {
          
          if (result) {
              dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                 // Congratulations! you're successed!
              });
          } else {
              dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                 // Configure wrong. The reason maybe password is wrong.
              });
          }
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
         // Error
      }];
  ```

* If you want to see historical configuration then use Api like thisï¼š

  ```objective-c
   [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] loadWifiConfiguration:^(NSDictionary * _Nullable result) {
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
              // Congratulations! you're successed!
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
         // Error
      }]; 
  ```

* How to load the system information of energy management system?

  **Just call this api:**

  The result will be called back by `loadSystemInfo`.But it should be noted that this is not a very stable callback, you may try to send the command multiple times after ensuring that the direct connection is successful.

  ```objective-c
      [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] loadSystemInfo:^( NSDictionary * _Nullable result) {
          
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
   // Congratulations! you're successed if the info not nil.
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
         // Error
      }];
  ```
  
* How to load the running information of energy management system?

  **Just call this api:**

  The result will be called back by `loadRunningInfo`.But it should be noted that this is not a very stable callback, you may try to send the command multiple times after ensuring that the direct connection is successful.

  ```objective-c
   [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] loadRunningInfo:^( NSDictionary * _Nullable result) {
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
              // Congratulations! you're successed if the info not nil.
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
          // Error
      }];
  ```
  
* How to load the self-check information of energy management system?

  **Just call this api:**

  The result will be called back by `loadSelfCheckInfo`.But it should be noted that this is not a very stable callback, you may try to send the command multiple times after ensuring that the direct connection is successful.

  ```objective-c
    [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] loadSelfCheckInfo:^(NSDictionary * _Nullable result) {
          dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
   // Congratulations! you're successed if the info not nil.
          });
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
         // Error
      }];
  ```
  
* And the last question, how to configuration the energy storage device with parameters?

  ```objective-c
   WTUpdateModel *update = [[WTUpdateModel alloc] init];
      update.ACDC = @"3";
      update.CTRate = @"1";
      update.GridMeterCTE = @"0";
      update.Meter_CT_Select = @"2";
      update.OnGridCap = @"5000";
      update.ReliefMode = @"1";
      update.SafetyType = @"25";
      update.SelfUseOrEconomic = @"0";
      update.VPPMode = @"1";
      [[WTWifiCenter sharedInstance] updateEMSConfigurationByElinterWith:update success:^(bool result) {
          // Congratulations! you're successed.
      } failure:^(NSError * _Nullable error) {
          // Error
      }];
  ```
